### Hi there 👋

I'm a camper, fisher, and fun father and our who enjoys getting outside with his kiddos.  I also love Open Source and blogging.  
I cut my teeth in SCM/Build/Tooling and later these practices morphed into DevOps and SRE.  I'm all in on the cloud, but find value in maintaining my own on-prem clusters for learning and practice.
